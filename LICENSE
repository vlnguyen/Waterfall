It's not like I'm going to come after you legally for using
this free StepMania theme in any particular way, so there really
isn't much of a point to whatever I put here.

That said, I ask that this not be redistributed by any third
parties unless given permission by me (SteveReen). Linking to the
original location the theme was uploaded to by the creator is fine,
but I'd prefer not to have it hosted elsewhere.

Modifying stuff, lifting code etc is all fine, encouraged even.
