# now we get into the longer explanations of options

[OptionExplanations]
# Top-level Service menu items
System Options=Change the game type, the theme, the language, and more.
Key Joy Mappings=Map keyboard keys, panels, menu buttons, etc. to game functions.
Test Input=Test the responsiveness of your dance pad.
Input Options=Adjust input options such as joystick automapping, dedicated menu buttons, and input debounce.
Arcade Options=Change options typically associated with arcade games.
Visual Options=Change the way lyrics, backgrounds, etc. are displayed during gameplay; adjust overscan.
Appearance Options=Change the way things are displayed during gameplay (lyrics, backgrounds, etc.).
Theme Options=Adjust settings specific to this theme.
Customize Profile=Customize some Waterfall-specific profile attributes.
USB Profile Options=Adjust settings related to USB Profiles, including loading custom songs from USB sticks.
MenuTimer Options=Turn the MenuTimer On or Off and set the MenuTimer values for various screens.
Acknowledgments=This theme would not exist without Simply Love, so these credits are left in.
Clear Credits=Reset coin credits to 0.


# System Options
Game=Change the current game type.\n\n• dance is 4-panel (DDR and ITG).\n• pump is 5-panel (Pump It Up).\n• techno is 8-panel (TechnoMotion).\n\npara and kb7 are not 100% supported in Simply Love but should be playable.\n\nbeat, kickbox, and lights are not playable in Simply Love.
Theme=Change the look and feel of StepMania.\n\nThemes often extend the base functionality of SM5 in unique ways.
Language=Choose your language.\nCurrently, this theme only fully supports English, but partial support from Simply Love is left over for some other languages.
Announcer=Choose a gameplay announcer from this list of packs you have installed.
DefaultNoteSkin=Select the default noteskin to use when playing.\n\nThis can be changed by players if they wish in the Player Options menu prior to gameplay.
Editor Noteskin=Select the default noteskin for Edit Mode.

# Visual Options
Set BG Fit Mode=Adjust how StepMania will display (scale, crop, etc.) backgrounds during gameplay.

# Graphics/Sound Options
VideoRenderer=opengl supports all visual effects, but might have a slightly lower frame rate.\n\nd3d might have a slightly higher frame rate but it does not support some visual effects.  Many "mod charts" (for example, content from TaroNuke) are visually  unplayable when using d3d.\n\nYou will need to restart SM5 if you change this for it to take effect.
SmoothLines=Toggle whether certain theme components are rendered with antialiased lines.\n\nSpecifically, any theme or simfile that utilizes an ActorMultiVertex in 'LineStrip' mode will be impacted by this setting.
FastNoteRendering=If enabled, the z buffer is not cleared after every note.  This causes 3D noteskins to collide, but substantially improves performance in gameplay.
ShowStats=Display performance statistics in the upper right corner of the screen and show frame skips in the lower right.\n\nFPS = frames per second\nVPF = vertices per frame\n\nA high VPF count indicates that the theme is drawing complex things and requires better hardware (or better programming) to maintain a steady FPS.\n\nThis feature can be toggled at any time by pressing F3+6.
VisualDelaySeconds=Subtract or add this many milliseconds of visual delay to gameplay.\n\nNegative values can be used to compensate for an LCD TV with a lot of "lag" or latency.

# Appearance Options
ShowLyrics=Toggle the display of song lyrics during gameplay if they are available.\n\nLyrics can be provided on a per-song basis by using a .lrc file.
ShowBanners=Toggle the display of song banners during Select Music if they are available.
BGBrightness=Control how bright the background will appear during gameplay.\n\nLower values result in a darker background.  0% is completely black.
RandomBackgroundMode=• Off - Display the background(s) specified by the current song.\n\n• Random Animations – Show randomly selected items from the BGAnimations folder during gameplay.\n\n• Random Movies - Show randomly selected items in the RandomMovies folder during gameplay.
NumBackgrounds=Choose the number of random backgrounds that will cycle per song.\n\nIf Random Gameplay Backgrounds is 'Off', this has no effect.
Center1Player=Turn this option 'On' to center the notefield during gameplay when only one player is active.
ShowDancingCharacters=If you have dancing characters installed, players can choose one from the third PlayerOptions menu in Simply Love.\n\nOther themes may use the "Select" choice to show a Character Select screen, but Simply Love does not.\n\nIf you do not have dancing characters installed, this setting will have no impact in any theme.

# Arcade Options
EventMode=• Off - Play a specific number of songs per game.\n\n• On - Play as many songs as you want per game.  Play all day if you want; I'm not your mom. 🤷
CoinMode=• Home - Options are shown on the Title screen.\n\n• Pay - Title screen choices are hidden; players must insert credits before playing. Pay mode is only possible when Event Mode is "Off."\n\n• Free Play - Title screen choices are hidden; no credits required to play.
CoinsPerCredit=This setting only applies when Coin Mode is set to 'Pay'.\n\nSpecify how many coins are needed for one credit.
Premium=This setting only applies when Coin Mode is set to 'Pay'.\n\n• 'Off' means one player can play with one credit\n\nThe remaining two options are surprisingly self-explanatory.
SongsPerPlay=This limits the number of songs per game when Event Mode is set to 'Off'.
Long Time=This is the length at which a song counts as two rounds.\n\nSet this to 'Off' if you don't want any songs to count as two rounds.
Marathon Time=This is the length at which a song counts as three rounds.\n\nIf Songs Per Play is set to 2, any song that counts as three rounds will not appear as a choice.\n\nSet this to 'Off' if you don't want any songs to count as three rounds.
AllowMultipleHighScoreWithSameName=Set this to 'Off' to prevent a single player from dominating the high score list for a given song.  Each chart will only allow one of a given high score handle.\n\nSet this to 'On' if you own your machine and wish to track your own progress.
ComboContinuesBetweenSongs=If turned off, the combo will reset to 0 between each song.\n\nIf turned on, the combo will carry between songs (and between unique games if profiles are not in use, which is typically the case...).
Disqualification=If turned off, players cannot be disqualified from earning high scores.\n\nIf enabled, certain conditions (CMod on charts with speed changes, disabling attacks on charts with attacks, etc.) will disqualify players from earning high scores.


# Input Options
OnlyDedicatedMenuButtons=• Use Gameplay Buttons - Navigate through the game using your dance pad.\n\n• Only Dedicated Buttons - Navigate through the game using dedicated menu buttons, presumably on an arcade cabinet.\n\nPlease ensure your menu buttons are mapped before changing this setting, otherwise you might get stuck.
ThreeKeyNavigation=Enable this if you only have three MenuButtons per player (e.g. a traditional DDR arcade cabinet).  Some UI elements will change to reflect this.\n\nWith this enabled, you can save screenshots at Evaluation by simultaneously pressing &MENULEFT; and &MENURIGHT;.
ArcadeOptionsNavigation=This impacts how option menus are navigated.\n\n• StepMania Style - &START; button moves to end.\n\n• Arcade Style - &START; button moves to next option line.
InputDebounceTime=Time that a panel takes to de-press.  Use this to deal with ghost steps that occur a few milliseconds after a real step.
AxisFix=Set this to "On" if you use a USB adapter to connect your dance pad and certain jumps (for example, Up-Down jumps, Left-Right jumps, etc.) always register as "Miss".  This may fix the issue.
#'

# Theme Options
AutoStyle=Set this if you ALWAYS play a certain style and want to get to gameplay as fast as possible.\n\nSet this to "None" if you want to choose a style like "1 Player" or "2 Players" for each new game cycle.
AllowFailingOutOfSet=If 'Yes' players can potentially fail out of a set early.  If 'No' players will always be able to play all their songs.\n\nThis has no impact in Event Mode.
NumberOfContinuesAllowed=Allow players to chain multiple games together by entering extra credits. Set this to 0 if you want to disable it.\n\nThis feature only applies to Pay Mode, because credits only exist in Pay Mode.
MusicWheelSpeed=Change the speed at which the MusicWheel will scroll through content.\n\nA faster MusicWheel is especially helpful when the MenuTimer is enabled.

AllowScreenSelectProfile=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Select Profile screen.\n\nThe Select Profile screen can be helpful if you have multiple local profiles.
AllowScreenEvalSummary=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Evaluation Summary screen.
AllowScreenNameEntry=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Name Entry screen.\n\nThe Name Entry screen is always skipped in Casual mode, regardless of this setting.
AllowScreenGameOver=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Game Over screen.

MusicWheelStyle=Set this to 'IIDX' if you want the MusicWheel to hide other, inactive song groups when actively browsing one.
AllowDanceSolo=Set this to 'Yes' if you want to enable Solo as a selectable option so you can play the handful of 6-panel charts in:\n\n• Solo Bass Mix\n• Solo 2000\n• Solo 4th Mix\n• foonmix\n• Solo Doubles 🤫\n\nThis only impacts 'Dance' game mode.
HideStockNoteSkins=Set this to 'Hide' if you want to hide all NoteSkins that come with SM5 from the modifier menu.
EvalAllowUpDownArrows=Some cabinet setups don't have buttons for MenuUp and MenuDown. Enable this to allow &UP; and &DOWN; to switch graphs on the Evaluation screen.
#'
AlwaysMergeScores=Enable this to "merge" scores from various Stats.xml files used by other themes into the WF profile stats every time profiles load. This adds a little bit to profile load time, so it's disabled by default.
#'
PreloadGrades=Calculating the clear types/grades for folders can cause slight lag while the song wheel is scrolling, so enable this to preload them for each player. Note that these get cached in real time either way, so after some scrolling around in the song wheel the lag will go away without this enabled.

ShowGradesInMusicWheel=Show or hide letter grades for each song you've played within the MusicWheel.\n\nPlease note that you'll need to be using a profile (local or USB) for this to work.
CasualMaxMeter=Charts harder than this will be filtered out of Casual Mode.
UseImageCache=Casual Mode will run more smoothly with the ImageCache system on, but StepMania will use a LOT more RAM as a consequence. It is recommended that you have at least 8GB of RAM to use the ImageCache system.\n\nYou will need to restart StepMania after turning this setting on for it to take effect.


# Customize Profile Options
ProfileCardInfo=Choose which information to show on your Profile Card.
PreferredGraph=Choose which graph to show below the primary pane at Evaluation by default.
PreferredSecondPane=Choose which pane to show by default for the secondary side at Evaluation.
PreferredSecondGraph=Choose which graph to show below the secondary pane at Evaluation by default.
PreferredGameEnv=Choose which game environment to load into upon starting a set. Note that you can still change environments mid-set, and changing it during a set will not change this preference.
GSOverride=Enable this if you always want to see the GrooveStats records instead of local records at the song select screen when in ITG mode, regardless of the current rate mod. This theme separates scores by rate mod but GS does not, so you may prefer one or the other.

# USB MemoryCard Options
MemoryCards=Allow players to save preferences and personal high scores to USB drives.\n\nNote that you must configure your computer's OS (outside of StepMania) to mount USB drives a specific way first for this to work.\n\nConsult the Wiki on StepMania's GitHub for detailed instructions about this.\n\ngithub.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki
CustomSongsEnable=Allow custom songs to be loaded from USB profiles.
CustomSongsMaxCount=Use this to limit the number of songs that will be loaded from a given USB profile.
